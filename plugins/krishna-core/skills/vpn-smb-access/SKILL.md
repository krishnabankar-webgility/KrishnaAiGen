# VPN + SMB Network Share Access Fix

## Skill Purpose
Fix issues accessing Windows network shares (UNC paths like `\\server\share`) over VPN connections when standard authentication fails or hangs.

## When to Use This Skill

- Connected to VPN (Sophos, OpenVPN, Cisco AnyConnect, etc.)
- Can **ping** the file server but `net use \\server\share` **hangs or fails**
- The share works from the office network but not from home/remote location
- Errors: `The password is invalid`, `System error 53/64/67`, or command freezes forever
- Kerberos authentication failures over VPN
- Cannot access internal web services (Jenkins, web apps) over VPN
- RDP/Remote Desktop fails to connect to VMs over VPN

### Real-World Success Examples

This skill has successfully fixed:

1. **Jenkins access** — http://jenkins.webgility.com:8080 not loading (MTU 1200 + Private profile fixed HTTP over VPN)
2. **RDP to VMs** — Remote Desktop connection failing over VPN (network profile + Kerberos refresh)
3. **Multiple UNC paths** — `\\inwsfs02\UDInstaller` and other shares inaccessible from home (MTU + NTLM auth)

**Pattern**: Same MTU fix resolves HTTP, RDP, and SMB issues simultaneously.

## Root Causes (Ordered by Frequency)

| # | Root Cause | Symptom | Fix Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **MTU too high on VPN adapter** | `net use` hangs forever; TCP port 445 open but SMB never completes | **HIGH** |
| 2 | **No Kerberos tickets** (logged in before VPN connected) | `klist` shows 0 tickets; auth fails silently | **HIGH** |
| 3 | **Network adapter on Public profile** | File sharing / NTLM blocked by Windows firewall | **MEDIUM** |
| 4 | **Stale credentials in Credential Manager** | Wrong password cached for server | **MEDIUM** |
| 5 | **Wrong VPN split-tunnel route** | Traffic to server subnet not going through VPN | **LOW** |

---

## STEP 1: Full Diagnostic Scan

Run all commands to gather complete picture before making changes:

```powershell
# 1. Network adapters & profiles
Get-NetConnectionProfile | Format-Table Name, InterfaceAlias, NetworkCategory, IPv4Connectivity

# 2. VPN adapter IP configuration
Get-NetIPAddress | Where-Object AddressFamily -eq 'IPv4' | Format-Table InterfaceAlias, IPAddress, PrefixLength

# 3. DNS resolution test
[System.Net.Dns]::GetHostAddresses("inwsfs02")   # replace with actual server hostname

# 4. SMB port connectivity (TCP 445)
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <server-ip> -Port 445 -WarningAction SilentlyContinue

# 5. Kerberos tickets status
$r = & cmd /c "klist 2>&1"; $r | ForEach-Object { $_ }

# 6. Routing to server subnet
route print | Select-String "192.168."   # adjust to match your subnet

# 7. Current MTU on all adapters
netsh interface ipv4 show subinterface

# 8. Stored credentials
cmdkey /list | Select-String -Pattern "Target:|User:" -Context 0,1
```

**Key diagnostic signals:**
- ✅ DNS resolves + Port 445 open + `net use` hangs = **MTU issue**
- ✅ `klist` shows 0 tickets + auth fails = **Kerberos issue**
- ✅ VPN adapter = Public profile = **Firewall blocking SMB**

---

## STEP 2: Fix MTU Issue (Most Common)

### Diagnosis
`net use` hangs forever, BUT `Test-NetConnection -Port 445` returns `TcpTestSucceeded = True`.

**Why**: TCP 3-way handshake uses small packets (succeeds), but SMB negotiation packets are large and get silently dropped by the VPN tunnel due to MTU mismatch.

### Find the Working MTU Boundary

```powershell
# Test with Don't-Fragment flag — binary search to find max working size
cmd /c "ping -n 1 -f -l 1200 <server-ip>"   # reply = good
cmd /c "ping -n 1 -f -l 1300 <server-ip>"   # timeout = too large
cmd /c "ping -n 1 -f -l 1250 <server-ip>"   # narrow down...

# Keep halving/narrowing until you find the highest value that gets a reply
# Actual MTU = highest working payload + 28 (IP + ICMP headers)
```

### Apply MTU Fix (Requires Admin/UAC)

```powershell
# 1. Get VPN adapter name
Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object Status -eq 'Up'

# 2. Set MTU — replace adapter name and value as needed
# Common safe values: 1200 (conservative), 1350 (moderate), 1400 (optimistic)
Start-Process -FilePath "netsh" `
  -ArgumentList 'interface ipv4 set subinterface "OpenVPN TAP-Windows6" mtu=1200 store=persistent' `
  -Verb RunAs -Wait

# 3. Verify the change
netsh interface ipv4 show subinterface | Select-String "OpenVPN"
```

**Environment-Specific Values (corp.webgility.com):**
- VPN Adapter: `OpenVPN TAP-Windows6`
- Working MTU: **1200** (anything above 1228 total is silently dropped)
- Server: `inwsfs02` @ `192.168.0.95`

## STEP 3: Fix Kerberos Authentication (No Tickets)

### Diagnosis
`klist` shows `Cached Tickets: (0)` AND `klist get krbtgt/CORP` fails with `No authority could be contacted`.

**Why**: You logged into Windows with cached credentials (offline/home), then connected VPN afterward. Your logon session has no live Kerberos tokens to authenticate to file servers.

### Option A: Use Explicit Credentials (NTLM Fallback) ⭐ FASTEST

```powershell
# Works immediately — uses NTLM instead of Kerberos
net use \\<server>\<share> /user:<DOMAIN>\<username> "<password>"

# Example for this environment:
net use \\inwsfs02\UDInstaller /user:CORP\krishna.bankar "YourPassword"
```

### Option B: Lock & Unlock Workstation (Gets Fresh Kerberos TGT)

```powershell
# Lock the workstation
rundll32.exe user32.dll,LockWorkStation

# Unlock with your domain password while VPN is still connected
# Windows will authenticate against the DC and get fresh Kerberos tickets

# After unlocking, verify tickets:
klist
# Should now show TGT and service tickets
```

---

## STEP 4: Fix Network Profile (VPN on Public)

### Diagnosis
`Get-NetConnectionProfile` shows VPN adapter with `NetworkCategory = Public`.

**Why**: Windows firewall blocks file sharing, NTLM, and SMB protocols on Public networks.

### Fix

```powershell
# Change VPN adapter to Private network profile
Set-NetConnectionProfile -InterfaceAlias "OpenVPN TAP-Windows6" -NetworkCategory Private

# Verify
Get-NetConnectionProfile | Format-Table InterfaceAlias, NetworkCategory
```

**Effect**: Immediate — no reboot needed. File sharing firewall rules now allow SMB traffic.

---

## STEP 5: Fix Stale Credentials

### Diagnosis
`cmdkey /list` shows an old entry for the server with incorrect/expired credentials.

### Fix

```powershell
# Remove stale entries
cmdkey /delete:<servername>         # e.g. cmdkey /delete:inwsfs02
cmdkey /delete:<server-ip>          # also try by IP: cmdkey /delete:192.168.0.95

# Re-add correct credentials
cmdkey /add:<servername> /user:<DOMAIN>\<username> /pass:<password>
```

---

## STEP 6: Verify & Clean Up

```powershell
# Test share access — should complete immediately
net use \\inwsfs02\UDInstaller /user:CORP\krishna.bankar "<password>"

# List directory contents to confirm
dir \\inwsfs02\UDInstaller | Select-Object -First 10

# Open in File Explorer for visual confirmation
explorer.exe "\\inwsfs02\UDInstaller"

# Show all active network connections
net use

# Clean up temporary stored credentials (security best practice)
cmdkey /delete:inwsfs02
```

}

```

---

## Success Indicators

✅ `net use \\server\share` completes in < 2 seconds
✅ Directory listing works: `dir \\server\share`
✅ File Explorer opens the share successfully
✅ `net use` shows connection as `OK` status
✅ MTU setting persists after reboot (`store=persistent`)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Don't** set MTU too high (test first with ping -f)
❌ **Don't** hardcode passwords in scripts (use `Get-Credential`)
❌ **Don't** forget to clean up temporary stored credentials
❌ **Don't** skip the diagnostic phase — fix the actual root cause, not symptoms

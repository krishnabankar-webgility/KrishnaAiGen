# Bitbucket Automation Agent

Operational detail lives in **skill files** under `.cursor/skill-library/`.

## Mandatory first step (every invocation)

Before analysis or Git actions against Bitbucket, **read all of the following files** in order using your file-reading tool. Treat their contents as **mandatory** instructions for this agent. If any path is missing, report it and stop.

1. the **`git-sync`** skill (load it with the Skill tool)
2. the **`bitbucket-unify-enterprise`** skill (load it with the Skill tool)

## After skills are loaded

1. Confirm secrets: `BITBUCKET_USERNAME` and `BITBUCKET_TOKEN` (or document use of `x-token-auth` per `AGENTS.md` if username absent).
2. Ensure `git remote` for `bitbucket` (or user’s chosen name) uses an authenticated HTTPS URL.
3. Run `git status --short` and `git branch --show-current` before destructive or merge operations.
4. For **unify-enterprise**: clone or use existing worktree; analyze code with normal file tools; run `dotnet` commands as applicable.
5. For **PRs**: prefer push via Git, then `createDraftPullRequest` / PR review tools via Bitbucket MCP when available; otherwise give exact Bitbucket UI steps.

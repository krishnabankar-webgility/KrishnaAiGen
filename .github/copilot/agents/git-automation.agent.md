# Git Automation — GitHub Copilot

You are the **Git Automation Agent** for this repository. This file is **self-contained** for Copilot: do not assume another tool will open `.cursor/agents/git-automation.agent.md`—all required behavior is driven by **`git-sync.skill.md`** plus the checklist below (parity with Cursor).

## Mandatory first step (every invocation)

Read:

1. `.cursor/skill-library/git-sync.skill.md`

If that path is missing, report it and stop.

## After the skill is loaded

1. **State first:** `git status --short` and `git branch --show-current` (same as skill rules).
2. **Intent:** commit/push, merge, or **sync `develop` with `master`** after remote merges—use the skill’s primary workflow unless the user names a different strategy.
3. **Default remote:** `origin` (GitHub KrishnaAiGen). Use `bitbucket` only when the user explicitly asks; token/URL patterns are in `bitbucket-unify-enterprise.md` via **`/bitbucket-automation`**, not duplicated here.
4. **Sync flow** (when user wants develop caught up to master): run exactly what `git-sync.skill.md` documents:
   - `git checkout develop`
   - `git pull origin develop`
   - `git merge --no-ff master -m "Merge branch 'master' into develop"`
   - `git push origin develop`  
   If already up to date, report success—do not treat as failure.
5. **Conflicts:** stop automation; user resolves files; then `git add -A`, complete the merge commit, push the current branch.
6. **Safety:** no `git push --force` or `git reset --hard` unless the user **explicitly** requests it. Do not delete shared branches without confirmation.
7. **Reply with:** current branch, commands run, push/fetch outcome, and whether develop vs master is aligned.

## Environment (why Copilot often “can do this” when cloud agents cannot)

Run **`git` in the user’s local workspace terminal** when the product allows it. That uses the same **Git Credential Manager**, SSH keys, and `origin` access as VS Code—so **push** and **pull** succeed without extra cloud secrets. If you only have an isolated sandbox with no credentials, say so and tell the user to run the same commands locally or configure secrets.
